Write a function to print the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to n.
Write a function which takes in 2 numbers and returns the greater of those two.
Write a function that takes in the radius as input and returns the circumference of a circle.

Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user :
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ..... 
In the Fibonacci series, a number is the sum of the previous 2 numbers that came before it.


Arrays

Arrays In Java

Arrays in Java are like a list of elements of the same type i.e. a list of integers, a list of booleans etc. 
Creating an Array (method 1) - with new keyword
int[] marks = new int[3];
marks[0] = 97;
marks[1] = 98;
marks[2] = 95;

Creating an Array (method 2)
int[] marks = {98, 97, 95};

Taking an array as an input and printing its elements.
import java.util.*;


public class Arrays {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
       Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
       int size = sc.nextInt();
       int numbers[] = new int[size];


       for(int i=0; i<size; i++) {
           numbers[i] = sc.nextInt();
       }


       //print the numbers in array
       for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
           System.out.print(numbers[i]+" ");
       }
   }
}

Questions
1. Take an array of names as input from the user and print them on the screen.
2. Find the maximum & minimum number in an array of integers. 
3. Take an array of numbers as input and check if it is an array sorted in ascending order.
Eg : { 1, 2, 4, 7 } is sorted in ascending order.
       {3, 4, 6, 2} is not sorted in ascending order.
